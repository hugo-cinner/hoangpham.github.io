				<title>Knowledge Distilation for Deep Neural Network</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently achieved great success in many natural language processing as well as computer vision tasks. However, they are becoming increasingly deeper, complex, computationally expensive and memory intensive. Some representatives of this trend are the deep language representation models, which includes BERT, ELMo, and GPT. This hinders their deployment in devices with low resources or in applications with strict latency requirements. Therefor, a natural thought is to perform model compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing the model performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>An Overview of Machine Learning</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) or more specifically Machine Learning is so pervasive that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. The self-driving cars of Google and Tesla or Siri - a virtual assistant of Apple are just a few of many AI / Machine Learning applications. In this post, I will show you an overview of machine learning as well as introduce the major types of machine learning algorithms, explain the purpose of each of them, and see what the benefits are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
