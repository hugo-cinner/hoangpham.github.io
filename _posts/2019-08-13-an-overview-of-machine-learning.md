> In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) or more specifically Machine Learning is so pervasive that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. The self-driving cars of Google and Tesla or Siri - a virtual assistant of Apple are just a few of many AI / Machine Learning applications. In this post, I will show you an overview of machine learning as well as introduce the major types of machine learning algorithms, explain the purpose of each of them, and see what the benefits are.

## What is machine learning?
> In this part, I will try to define what is machine learning and give you a sense of when you want to use machine learning.

### Machine learning definition
Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than you’d expect. You can see an example about Machine Learning applications in [Machine Learning in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-in-action) as below:

*One day, you realize it’s your friend’s birthday and want to send her a card via snail mail.
You search for funny cards, and the search engine shows you the 10 most relevant links.
You click the second link; the search engine learns from this.
Next, you check some email, and without your noticing it, the spam filter catches unsolicited ads for pharmaceuticals and places them in the Spam folder.
Next, you head to the store to buy the birthday card.
When you’re shopping for the card, you pick up some diapers for your friend’s child.
When you get to the checkout and purchase the items, the human operating the cash register hands you a coupon for $1 off a six-pack of beer.
The cash register’s software generated this coupon for you because people who buy diapers also tend to buy beer.
You send the birthday card to your friend, and a machine at the post office recognizes your handwriting to direct the mail to the proper delivery truck.
Next, you go to the loan agent and ask them if you are eligible for loan;
they don’t answer but plug some financial information about you into the computer and a decision is made.
Finally, you head to the casino for some late-night entertainment, and as you walk in the door, the person walking in behind you gets approached by security seemingly out of nowhere.
They tell him, "Sorry, Mr. Thorp, we’re going to have to ask you to leave the casino. Card counters aren’t welcome here."*

Machine Learning was present in all of the previously mentioned scenarios. But what is Machine Learning?

Wikipedia defines [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) as:
> Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

In the definition of Wikipedia, we focus on 2 things:
 - **Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models** Machine learning uses statistics
 - Machine learning is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
Normally, machine learning is sub-categorized to three types as the below:

### Supervised Learning
Wikipedia defines [Supervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) as:
> Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.


### Unsupervised Learning

### Semi-supervised Learning

### Reinforcement Learning
